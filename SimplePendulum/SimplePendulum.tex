\begin{abstract}
Integration along the transcendental Hamiltonian function $\alpha=2H(p,q)=p^2+\sin(q)^2$ 
predicts the time-dependence of simple pendulum libration when $\alpha \in (0,1)$. By 
equivalence via canonical transformation, the same can be said for the 
algebraic Hamiltonian function,
$$\alpha=2H(p,q)=\Big(p^2+q^2\Big)\Big(1-\frac{1}{4}q^2\Big),$$ 
a close relative to Harold Edwards's normal form for elliptic curves. Combining real and 
complex transformation theory with Edwards's theory of elliptic curves and elliptic 
functions, we derive an exact solution of the simple pendulum's librational equations of 
motion.

The universal law of gravitation guarantees an analogy between the 
libration of a pendulum around its fixed axis and the orbital motion of 
a planet around its central star. The entire analogy goes deeper than to simply
describe a planet and a pendulum bob as massive objects affected by 
gravitational forces. In both cases, the equations of motion have oscillating
solutions, which return to their initial conditions after a fixed interval of 
time. In both cases, the recurrence periods depend on an amplitude parameter
that enters through the initial conditions. Here the analogy reveals its great 
fallacy. The two period functions do not share very many similarities, 
nor are they equally difficult to solve or to measure. The discovery and 
resolution of this dichotomy plays across many interesting chapters from the 
history of science, and leads into the subject matter of this current work.

About a century before the advent of 
integral calculus, Galileo (1564-1642) made the simple observation that two 
pendulums of the same characteristic length will undergo isochronous 
oscillations. The observation does not hold true outside the small angle limit, 
as Galileo may very well have known\footnote{This speculation comes from Gosper:
"Do you think Galileo actually believed that pendulum periods are insensitive to 
amplitude?  I don't." on Sunday July 7, 2019, 05:33:49 UTC.}. A counterpoint to this 
story occurs in the researches of Kepler (1571-1630), who first discovered the three 
laws of planetary motion. The third law asserts that the square of a planet's yearly 
period is proportional to the cube of the orbital ellipse's semi-major axis length. 
In a sense, Kepler succeeded where Galileo could not. He was able to correctly 
ascertain the functional dependence of an oscillation period. Meanwhile, significant 
obstacles in theory and experiment stood between renaissance scientists and a better 
understanding of pendulum dynamics.  

Though the planets can not be controlled in a laboratory as can a pendulum bob, the 
planetary period function is sometimes easier to measure than that of a simple pendulum\footnote{For 
a popular historical discussion of Galileo, Kepler, and early measurements see Ref. \cite{STROGATZ2019}.}. 
Using only XVI century implements, an astronomer can chart the day-to-day motion of a 
planet at a resolution of tens or hundreds of data points per yearly cycle. 
Without digital acquisition of data, a similar sampling of pendulum motion at $10$ to 
$100$ Hertz is practically impossible. Dissipative losses introduce uncertainty to 
measured values and compound upon difficulties due to short timescale. Even if renaissance 
experimental scientists could have accurately measured changes of the pendulum's period on 
the order of a few percents, the analytic task of extracting a functional form would have been 
an impossible prospect before the theoretical advances of Euler (1707-1783). The period 
function in question is not algebraic, nor is it immediately easy to characterize by fitting 
only a few free parameters. 

Among hundreds of other topics, Euler initiated the general study of elliptic integrals and 
hypergeometric series, and subsequently solved exactly for the simple pendulum's amplitude 
dependence\footnote{Cf. Euler Archive: E028, E366, E503. http://eulerarchive.maa.org/.}. Careful 
examination of publication records reveals yet another example of Arnold's principle that 
"discoveries are rarely attributed to the correct person". Euler could already understand 
the hypergeometric function $\,_2 F_1(a,b;c;z)$ in terms of its characteristic differential 
equation, 
\begin{eqnarray}
a \;b\; F - \big(c-(a+b+1)z\big) \partial_{z}F - z(1-z)\partial_{z}^2 F = 0,  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
yet most authors credit the later Gauss (1777-1855), who gave a more systematic treatment 
and standardized notation, decades after Euler's exploratory work \cite{DUTKA84}. In any case, 
the hypergeometric function eventually came to be seen as a crown accomplishment of classical 
function theory and a \textit{sine qua non} of period analysis \cite{KZ2001}. 

Up to a scale degree of freedom, the two ordinary differential equations,
\begin{eqnarray}
3\;T-2\;\alpha \;\partial_{\alpha}T=0 \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \text{vs.} \nonumber
 \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; T-\partial_{\alpha}(4\;\alpha\;(1-\alpha)\;\partial_{\alpha}T)=0,
\end{eqnarray}
define the periods of planetary and pendulum motion respectively, as seen in Figure ~\ref{fig:TwoPeriods}.  
Integers $2$ and $3$ appearing in the first equation are the exponents already known to Kepler. 
Integer $4$ appearing in the second equation is not so easy to explain. Choosing hypergeometric parameters 
$(a,b,c)=(1/s,(s-1)/s,1)$, the general equation reduces to a factored form,
\begin{eqnarray}
(s-1)F-\partial_{z}\big(s^{2}\;z\;(1-z)\;\partial_{z}F\big)=0. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Usually the line $a+b=1$ intersects hyperbola $a\;b=(s-1)/s^2$ at two distinct points, 
while preserving reflection symmetry across the line $a=b$. Setting $s=2$, the line $a+b=1$ 
lays tangent to the hyperbola $a\;b=1/4$ at the symmetry point $a=b=1/2$, as in Fig.
~\ref{fig:abHypLin}. The choice $s=2$ also recovers the pendulum's characteristic 
differential equation, thus the appearance of integer $4$ acquires a special meaning 
through the hypergeometric theory. The decomposition of $4$ to $(a,b,c)=(1/2,1/2,1)$ 
produces all the necessary parameters to construct a series solution of the simple 
pendulum's period (Cf. Ref. \cite{GRAHAM1994}, Ch. 5).

Euler and Gauss developed a fine characterization of the gross dynamics of a simple pendulum, 
but left exact solution of the time-parameterization problem mostly an open question 
for the next few generations of researchers. The answering involved an honor roll 
of European patriarchs\textemdash Legendre, Riemann, Jacobi, Weierstrass and many others. Especially 
through the efforts of Abel (1802-1829), a central theme emerged that the time parameter 
can also take on complex values\footnote{For another closely related historical account
see Ref. \cite{POPESCU2016}.}. Subsequently during XX 
century the pendulum's exact solution in terms of standardized, doubly-periodic 
elliptic functions became a lauded final product of the classical era.

The XX century also saw the advent of Quantum Mechanics. During this time period, precise spectroscopic 
measurement of atoms and molecules confounded preexisting theories; however, physicists did ultimately 
discover that classical oscillations have 
somewhat odd counterparts in the quantum regime. Initial attempts to describe quantum oscillations 
built upon the concept of phase space. The mathematical prehistory of phase space goes back to Poincar\'{e} 
(1854-1912), but the work of Ehrenfest (1880-1933) marks the first occurrence of the the Deutsch 
word \textit{Phasenraum}\cite{NOLTE2010}. Thereafter Sommerfeld (1868-1951) included early depictions 
of two equivalent phase plane geometries in his famous text \textit{Atombau Und Spektrallinien}. 
To the uninitiate, the two drawings\textemdash reproduced here in Fig. ~\ref{fig:Sommerfeld}\textemdash 
are only curious works of abstract art. It is not immediately apparent that they describe harmonic 
oscillation, nor that they relate by a special coordinate transformation, nor that they can be deformed 
to account for non-linearity. These few basic facts of Hamiltonian Mechanics were widely understood by 
the last generation of classical analysts, and they are still important 
today\footnote{Especially in the development of Heller's "The Semiclassical Way" \cite{HELLER2018}.}. 

Modern texts follow and expound upon the figure drawing of Sommerfeld and others, making Hamiltonian
mechanics an attractive and delightful subject, especially for visual learners and abstract 
free-thinkers. The pendulum phase portrait, here Fig. ~\ref{fig:PendPortrait}, is an iconic standard. 
Both popular and specialist accounts\footnote{For example: \cite{STROGATZ2019} Chapter 11; \cite{STROGATZ2018} 
Chapter 6; \cite{HARTER2019} Unit 2, Chapter 7, etc.} usually include such a figure when developing the 
visual language. The more demanding references typically ask the student not only to recreate the figure 
drawing, but also to measure its dimensions in terms of a period integral. Strangely enough, the standard 
solution does not usually involve much geometry, instead shows that a pendulum's dimensionless falling/rising 
velocity $\dot{w}$ along the vertical coordinate $w$ satisfies an algebraic constraint, 
$\dot{w}^2=\frac{1}{4}w(1-w)(1-\alpha w)$. Change of variables by $w=\sin(\phi)^2$ then yields the 
textbook form, 
\begin{eqnarray}
T(\alpha) = 2 \int_{0}^{1} \frac{ dw}{\sqrt{w(1-w)(1-\alpha w)}} =
\oint \frac{ d\phi}{\sqrt{1-\alpha \sin(\phi)^2}} . \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Avoiding standards mimicry, we will use geometric methods to find, and to prove valid, a canonical 
Hamiltonian formulation where $q/p=\tan(\phi)$ and $\dot{\phi}=\sqrt{1-\alpha\sin(\phi)^2 }$. 
Discovery (or rediscovery) of the algebraic Hamiltonian function $2H(p,q)=(p^2+q^2)(1-\frac{1}{4}q^2)$ 
leads not only to quick derivation of the period integral, but also to an exact solution of the time 
parameterization problem via the Harold Edwards theory of elliptic curves and
functions.  

The article "A normal form for elliptic curves" testifies to Abel's inspirational genius, and stands 
as a paragon specimen of how mathematicians and scientists can use writing to promote alternative 
perspectives, fair attribution, and historical continuity \cite{EDWARDS2007}. History leads Edwards 
and his readers to a thoughtful and self-consistent revision of elliptic function theory. Simplification 
by symmetry is an important theme in this work of pure mathematics, but the results are not solely the 
product or possession of a leisure class. Interdisciplinary applications are part of the history and 
its followings. In cryptography, the simplified addition rule helps to optimize implementations of 
the widely-used Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol. Thus computer scientists have been among the 
first to accept and utilize the alternative paradigm. Edwards's normal form also presents physicists 
with an opportunity to break free from the confines of disciplinary boundaries and standard 
formulae\footnote{As hinted by D. Bernstein and T. Lange at Chaos Communication Congress 2015 \cite{}.}. 
Perhaps the future will have a better role for "Hamilton-Abel theory" than that of a clever joke or 
an idle dream. We will now commence an effort to synthesize physical Hamiltonian theory with the 
complex mathematics present in Harold Edwards's original masterpiece.

The simple pendulum consists of a massive bob attached by a solid rod, assumed 
massless, to an axle as in Fig.~\ref{fig:PendulumGeo}. Gravity acts on the bob with 
vertical force $mg$, and the attachment applies a response force. The rod feels 
extensive and compressive stresses, but is assumed to respond with zero strain.
As time elapses the bob swings and undergoes periodic motion 
along a circular trajectory of radius $l$. In \textit{librational motion}
the signs of angular coordinate $\theta$ and angular velocity $\dot{\theta}$ alternate 
while the pendulum reaches extremum deflection at regular intervals throughout the 
experiment. The time of one complete oscillation is called the \textit{period} and 
denoted by symbol $T$. In the absence of frictional damping a time series starting
from time $t=0$ at initial angle $\theta_0$ would have that $\theta(t)=\theta_0$ whenever 
$t/T\in \mathbb{N}$. More realistically, one period $T_n$ separates successive 
maxima $\theta_n$ and $\theta_{n+1}$, with a non-zero frictional loss $\delta\theta_n = 
\theta_{n+1}-\theta_n>0$. Only in the limit where $\delta\theta_n$ approaches zero, 
period $T_n=T_{n+1}$ becomes an exactly integrable observable. We shall work out the theory
assuming that $\delta\theta_n = 0$ regardless of $n$, while postponing worries about
fidelity to a followup article on experiment and data analysis.

The simple design of Fig.~\ref{fig:PendulumGeo} involves a few free 
parameters, collected in Table ~\ref{tab:PQList}. None of the initial parameters 
have dimension $[\;T\;]$ for time, but $[\;T\;]$ does occur as a factor in the 
dimensions of $g$. Without loss of generality, the $[\;L\;][\;M\;][\;T\;]$ dimensional 
system allows us to fix three scale degrees of freedom, i.e. to choose the base units
of length, mass, and time. The obvious choice $l=m=1$ scales dimensions $[\;L\;]$ and 
$[\;M\;]$. Another sensible choice, that $g=1$, forces $l/g=1$, 
so also sets the $[\;T\;]$-scale. Intuition can easily guess period $T$ proportional 
to fixed time $\sqrt{l/g}=1$. Such a guess pays no regard to the dimensionless 
amplitude parameter,
\begin{eqnarray}
\alpha = a_0/l = \frac{1}{2}\big( 1 - \cos(\theta_0) \big) =  \sin(\theta_0 / 2)^2. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Parameter $\alpha$ presents a difficulty to dimensional analysis by allowing that $T$ 
is a function and not just a single number. For any integer $n$, the quantity 
$\sqrt{l/g}\;\alpha^n$ has time dimension, as does any quantity $T \in \sqrt{l/g}\;\mathbb{Q}[\![\alpha]\!]$. 
An Ansatz for the period function, 
\begin{eqnarray}
T(\alpha)=\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}\sum_{n\ge 0}c_n \alpha^n, \nonumber
\end{eqnarray} 
includes infinitely many undetermined coefficients $c_n \in \mathbb{Q}$. These coefficients 
are not constrained by dimensional analysis. The task of determining them calls for a 
stronger approach, one predicated upon a combination of physical principle and
integral calculus.

Let the simple pendulum move in the $xz$ plane along the arc of a unit circle. Choosing 
the center at $(x,z)=(0,1)$ requires that  $x^2+(z-1)^2=1$, and that $x\;\dot{x}=(1-z)\;\dot{z}$.
By these two equations, the bivariate expression for conservation of energy,
$2(2\alpha-z)=\dot{x}^2+\dot{z}^2$, reduces to a univariate form, $\dot{z}^2=2z(2\alpha-z)(2-z)$. 
Re-scaled variable 
$w=z/(2\;\alpha)$ enables neat expression of the rising/falling velocity, but even greater 
simplicity follows from the choice of $w=\sin(\phi)^2$. The period integral then takes 
the form given in the introduction. Quarter-period integral
\begin{eqnarray}
K(\alpha)=T(\alpha)/4=\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{d\phi}{\sqrt{1-\alpha\;\sin(\phi)^2}}, 
\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
is such a famous standard that it has a long-winded name, \textit{the complete elliptic 
integral of the first kind} \cite{LL1982}. By formally verifying that $T(\alpha)=4K(\alpha)$, 
part $(a)$ of the typical textbook exercise is already completed. More challenging part 
$(b)$ asks for a closed form for the coefficients $c_n$. Term-by-term integration of 
the series expansion\footnote{Using that $(1-4\Phi)^{-1/2} = \sum \binom{2n}{n}\Phi^n $ 
and that $\oint (2\cos(\phi))^{2n} = \binom{2n}{n}$.} yields an exact solution in 
series,
\begin{eqnarray}
T(\alpha)= \oint \frac{d\phi}{\sqrt{1-\alpha \sin(\phi)^2}}=\sum \frac{1}{4^n}\binom{2n}{n} \alpha^n \oint\sin(\phi)^{2n}= 
2\pi \sum \frac{1}{16^n}\binom{2n}{n}^2 \alpha^n. \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
Unfortunately the answer $c_n=\frac{2\pi}{16^n}\binom{2n}{n}^2 $ does not contribute at all 
to intuition for the mysterious variable $\phi$. It is not really an answer, but instead
a placeholder for many more questions. Why does change of variables from $z$ to $\phi$ 
work so well? Does simplicity indicate a hidden meaning for $\phi$? Is $\phi$ actually
the angle of some particular geometric figure? 

Recall that each libration cycle involves an alternating pattern of extrema,
\begin{eqnarray}
\max(\dot{\theta}) \xrightarrow{\;\;\;\;K\;\;\;\;} \max(\theta) 
 \xrightarrow{\;\;\;\;K\;\;\;\;} \min(\dot{\theta})
 \xrightarrow{\;\;\;\;K\;\;\;\;} \min(\theta) 
 \xrightarrow{\;\;\;\;K\;\;\;\;} \max(\dot{\theta}) \nonumber,
\end{eqnarray} 
separated by equal time intervals of length $K(\alpha)$. This notation suggests that the 
abstraction $\phi$ relates somehow to the phase between hanging angle $\theta$ and its angular 
velocity $\dot{\theta}$. A simple hypothesis makes $\phi$ the angle of a polar coordinate
system where $\theta=r\sin(\phi)$ and $\dot{\theta}=r\cos(\phi)$. If correct, the hypothesis should 
enable another derivation of the exact same integrand $d\phi/\dot{\phi}$. Gravitational force 
$mg=1$ downward along the vertical results in a partial force along the tangent of motion, 
which affects an angular acceleration, and by Newton's laws, $\ddot{\theta}=-\sin(\theta)$. 
The phase angular velocity,
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{\phi} &=& \cos(\phi)^2 \frac{d}{dt} \tan(\phi) 
= \frac{\dot{\theta}^2}{\theta^2+\dot{\theta}^2}\frac{d}{dt}\bigg(\frac{\theta}{\dot{\theta}}\bigg)
=\frac{\dot{\theta}^2-\theta\ddot{\theta} }{\theta^2+\dot{\theta}^2}, \nonumber \\
&=& \cos(\phi)^2+\frac{\sin(\phi)}{r}\sin\big(r \sin(\phi)\big) \nonumber 
 = 1+\sum_{n>0} \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!} r^{2n} \sin(\phi)^{2n+2}, \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
looks hopelessly complicated. It is about to get even worse. Conservation of 
energy, ${4 \alpha=\dot{\theta}^2+4 \sin(\theta/2)^2}$, 
determines $r$ as a function of $\sin(\phi)$ and $\alpha$ by reversion of the series,
\begin{eqnarray}
4\alpha = r^2 + 2\sum_{n>0}\frac{(-1)^n }{(2n+2)!} \big(r \sin(\phi)\big)^{2n+2} .  
\text{\;\;\;\;\;\;(DC later!)}\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Fortunately, the current argument depends only on the linear variation of $T(\alpha)$. The 
inverse series takes a form $r^2=4\alpha + \mathcal{O}(\alpha^2)$, and substitution to $\dot{\phi}$
partially solves $T(\alpha)$, 
\begin{eqnarray}
T(\alpha)= \oint \frac{d\phi}{\dot{\phi}} = \oint d\phi\bigg(1+\frac{2}{3}\alpha\sin(\phi)^4 + \mathcal{O}(\alpha^2) \bigg).\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Integral identity $\oint d\phi \sin(\phi)^4=3/8$ ensures the correct value $c_1=1/4$. More 
importantly, the expansion shows by contradiction that $\tan(\phi) \neq \theta/\dot{\theta}$ 
because the linear term of $T(\alpha)$ is an integral of $\sin(\phi)^4$ rather than $\sin(\phi)^2$.
The false hypothesis is not entirely a loss. Similarity between alternative calculations of 
$T(\alpha)$ supports the idea that $\phi$ could be a phase angle. To find and prove the correct 
geometry, we will next give a short development of Hamiltonian mechanics, including a few basic 
facts from transformation theory.

\section{Phase Plane Geometry}

The \textit{phase plane} is a two-dimensional, Euclidean vector space spanned by 
Cartesian $(p,q)$ variables. These variables measure the state of a test mass as it 
undergoes classical motion along one dimension. A choice of coordinates involves infinitely
many hidden degrees of freedom, so it is usually not true that $p$ stands for momentum and 
$q$ for position. Hamiltonian mechanics reserves the letters $p$ and $q$ for those 
\textit{canonical coordinates}, which are defined to satisfy Hamilton's equations of motion,
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d}{dt}\Big(p,q\Big)= \Big(\dot{p},\dot{q}\Big) 
= \bigg(-\frac{\partial H }{\partial q}, \frac{\partial H}{\partial p} \bigg). \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Additional variables $H$ and $t$ stand for the Hamiltonian energy function and the special
time parameter, respectively. Again, we will assume $2H(p,q)=\alpha$ 
with $\dot{\alpha} = 0$, thus the Hamiltonian $H$ uniquely determines the conserved total 
energy at any state-point $(q,p)$. A three-dimensional visualization of function $H(q,p)$ 
superposes a surface,
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{H} = \{ \; (p,q,\alpha) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \; : \; \alpha = 2\;H(p,q) \; \}, \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
above the phase plane. Level sets of surface $\mathcal{H}$ project to phase 
curves,
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{C}_{\alpha} = \{ \; (p,q) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \; : \; \alpha = 2\;H(p,q), \;\; (\dot{p},\dot{q})\neq(0,0) \; \}. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
The tangent expansion of phase curve $\mathcal{C}_{\alpha}$ at energy $\alpha$, 
\begin{eqnarray}
d\alpha = 0 = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p}\;dp+\frac{\partial H}{\partial q}\;dq = \dot{q}\;dp-\dot{p}\;dq, \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
requires the existence of an \textit{invariant differential}, $dt = dp/\dot{p} = dq/\dot{q}$,
which solves the linear constraint equation. The integral $t=\int dt$ determines the time parameter 
$t$ of $\mathcal{C}_{\alpha}$ and, by inversion, solutions $q(t)$ and $p(t)$ to the equations of motion. 
At critical points where $(\dot{p},\dot{q})=(0,0)$, a tangent does not exist. Instead, the solution,  
$p(t)=p(0)$ and $q(t)=q(0)$, follows from the constant value theorem. 
 
In a case-by-case exposition of Hamiltonian mechanics, harmonic oscillation usually shows within 
the first few examples. The Hamiltonian, 
\begin{eqnarray}
2H(p,q)=\kappa_p \; p^2 + \kappa_q \; q^2,  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\Big(\kappa_p>0,\;\kappa_q>0\Big)\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
describes a paraboloid $\mathcal{H}$, and the phase curves $\mathcal{C}_{\alpha}$ 
are concentric ellipses when $\alpha>0$. At the point $(p,q)=(0,0)$, the system reaches a stable minimum 
with $\alpha=0$, positive principal curvatures, $\kappa_p$ and $\kappa_q$, and harmonic 
frequency $\omega = \sqrt{\kappa_p \;\kappa_q}$. Up to an initial condition $\phi_0$, trigonometric 
functions,
\begin{eqnarray}

solve Hamilton's equations, $(\dot{p},\dot{q})=(-\kappa_q \;q,\kappa_p \;p)$. A guess-and-check 
strategy works fine when the derivatives of sine and cosine are already known; however, repeating
the solution in polar coordinates helps to develop better insight.

Choosing dimensions $\kappa_p = \kappa_q=\omega$ puts paraboloid $\mathcal{H}$ into a most 
symmetrical, circular form, as in Fig. ~\ref{fig:CircPara}. In polar coordinates, 
${\big(p,q\big)=\big(r\;\cos(\phi),r \;\sin(\phi)\big)}$,
the Hamiltonian $2H(r)=\omega r^2$ depends only the radial coordinate and leaves the phase angle 
unconstrained. Conservation of energy sets radius $r=\sqrt{\alpha/\omega}$. Again from 
$\tan(\phi) = q/p$ it follows that ${\dot{\phi}=(p \dot{q}-\dot{p}q)/r^2=\omega}$ and that $\phi = \omega t + \phi_0$.
This calculation verifies the time parameterization, but more importantly 
allows proof, $\partial_r H(r) \neq \omega$, that $r$ and $\phi$ do not make a pair of 
canonical coordinates. Instead, the canonical choice is $\lambda = r^2/2$, and then 
Hamilton's equations work perfectly well, 
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{\phi}=\partial_{\lambda} H(\lambda) = \omega \;\;\;\;\;\;\; 
\text{and} 
\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \dot{\lambda}=-\partial_{\phi} H(\lambda) = 0 . \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
This observation unlocks the secret of Sommerfeld's second drawing. It is a particularly
plain picture of the harmonic oscillator phase curves in \textit{action-angle}
coordinates $(p,q)=(\lambda,\phi)$. Action-angle coordinates are an extremely useful
tool, and worthy of a proper introduction.

When stated without blas\'{e} language, the changing of a phase ellipse 
into circular form gives a seminal example of canonical transformation theory. The 
squeeze transformation $(p_i,q_i) \rightarrow (p_f,q_f)=(p_i\;k,q_i/k)$ scales the 
phase plane by a dimensionless factor $k$. Choosing $k=(\kappa_p/\kappa_q)^{1/4}$ recovers 
$2H(q,p)=\omega(p^2+q^2)$ from the earlier ${2H(q,p)=\kappa_p p^2+\kappa_q q^2}$. 
Hamilton's equations remain invariant, 
\begin{eqnarray}
\Big(\dot{p}_i,\dot{q}_i\Big) 
= \bigg(-\frac{\partial H }{\partial q_i}, \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i} \bigg) \nonumber
\longrightarrow
\Big(\dot{p}_f/k,\dot{q}_f\;k\Big) 
= \bigg(-\frac{\partial H }{\partial q_f}/k, \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_f}\;k \bigg),
\end{eqnarray}
as the extra factors $k$ cancel. Similarly, factors of $k$ cancel after transforming
the area two-form, $dp \wedge dq$. This is no coincidence. When coordinate $q$ holds 
constant, the tangent geometry requires that $dp/d\alpha = (2\dot{q})^{-1}$, and similar for 
$dq/d\alpha$ with $p$ constant. After applying Stokes's theorem, the time integrand 
obtains a profound form, $dt=2\partial_{\alpha} \int_H dp\wedge dq$. We can now ask a fundamental
question: which coordinate transformations leave $dt$ invariant, or equivalently, which 
transformations leave Hamilton's equations invariant?

Under a general transformation $(p_i,q_i) \rightarrow \big(p_f,q_f\big)$ the area form,
\begin{eqnarray}
dp_f \wedge dq_f = \bigg(\frac{\partial p_f}{\partial  p_i}dp_i+\frac{\partial p_f}{\partial q_i}dq_i\bigg)
\wedge\bigg(\frac{\partial q_f}{\partial p_i}dp_i+\frac{\partial q_f}{\partial q_i}dq_i\bigg)
=\det(J) \; dp_i \wedge dq_i,  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
scales according to the Jacobian matrix and its determinant,
\begin{eqnarray}
J= \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial p_f}{\partial p_i} & \frac{\partial p_f}{\partial q_i} \\
\frac{\partial q_f}{\partial p_i} & \frac{\partial q_f}{\partial q_i}
\end{bmatrix} \;\;\;\;\;\;\; \text{and} \;\;\;\;\;\;\; 
\det(J) = \frac{\partial p_f}{\partial p_i}\frac{\partial q_f}{\partial q_i}
 - \frac{\partial p_f}{\partial q_i}\frac{\partial q_f}{\partial p_i}. 
\nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
After characterizing the inverse transform $(p_f,q_f) \rightarrow \big(p_i,q_i\big)$ 
with an analogous matrix $\widetilde{J}$, action on the tangent vectors,
\begin{eqnarray}
(dp_f,dq_f)= J \cdot (dp_i,dq_i) 
\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \text{and} \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
(dp_i,dq_i)= \widetilde{J} \cdot (dp_f,dq_f). \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
ensures a product to identity, $\widetilde{J}J=\mathbb{I}$. Hamilton's equations 
transform accordingly,
\begin{eqnarray}
\big(\dot{p}_f,\dot{q}_f \big) = \bigg(-\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_f},\frac{\partial H}{\partial p_f}\bigg)   
\longrightarrow J \cdot \big(\dot{p}_i,\dot{q}_i \big) = 
P\cdot \widetilde{J} \cdot P \cdot \bigg(-\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i},\frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i}\bigg),
\nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
with permutation matrices $P$ such that $P \cdot J^{-1} \cdot P = J/\det(J)$. When 
$\det(J)=1$, the area form and Hamilton's equations remain invariant. The change of 
coordinates is then said to be a \textit{canonical transformation}. For example, the 
pair of Jacobians,
\begin{eqnarray}
J =  \begin{bmatrix} p_i & q_i \\
-q_i/(p_i^2+q_i^2) & p_i/(p_i^2+q_i^2)
\end{bmatrix}  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \text{and}  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; 
\widetilde{J} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(q_f)/\sqrt{2p_f} & -\sqrt{2p_f}\sin(q_f) \\
\sin(q_f)/\sqrt{2p_f} & \sqrt{2p_f}\cos(q_f) \end{bmatrix}\nonumber,
\end{eqnarray}
satsify $\det(J)=\det(\widetilde{J})=1$, thus action-angle coordinates 
$(p_f,q_f\big)=(\lambda,\phi)$ are proven canonical relative to position-momentum 
coordinates $(p_i,q_i)=(p,q)$. This fact also follows quite 
obviously from the simple calculation, $d\lambda \wedge d\phi = r dr\wedge d\phi$, 
because the right hand side reproduces the well-known area form of a polar 
coordinate system.

Though Jacobian matrices simplify validation of coordinate transformations, 
their content excludes any mention of time, energy, or the Hamiltonian 
function. The integral identity,
\begin{eqnarray}
t = \int_{0}^{t} dt' = 2\partial_{\alpha}\int\!\!\!\!\int_{H} dp\wedge dq
=2 \partial_{\alpha} S(\alpha,p,q), \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
tells more, that time $t$ depends on the area $S(\alpha,p,q)$
beneath curve $\mathcal{C}_{\alpha}$ and between a valid initial and final 
condition, $(p_0,q_0)$ and $(p,q)$ respectively. The Hamiltonian flow, 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{F} = \big\{\big(p,q,t\big) \in \mathbb{R}^3 : t= 2 \partial_{\alpha} S(\alpha,p,q)  \big\}, \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
equates time evolution with a solid geometry in phase-space-time 
(Deutsch: \textit{phasenraumzeit}). For harmonic oscillation, we can choose initial conditions such that 
$2 S(\alpha,\lambda,\phi) = (\phi/\omega)\;\alpha$, and then the flow goes along a helicoid spiral over 
circular phase curves. In Fig. \ref{fig:Helicoid}, both flows repeat after a vertical time-translation 
of ${T=2\pi/\omega}$, because any closed curve $\mathcal{C}_{\alpha}$ bounds an entire area, 
${S(\alpha)=\pi r^2=(\pi/\omega)\alpha}$. Amplitude independence of period $T$ characterizes 
harmonic oscillation. Usually amplitude dependence 
cannot be avoided, so the harmonic equations of motion are, at best, only valid and useful as an 
approximation in the infinitesimal limit. More generally, \textit{anharmonic oscillation} along curve 
$\mathcal{C}_{\alpha}$ returns to initial condition $(p_0,q_0)$ after a period $T(\alpha)$, 
which characteristically \textit{must vary} with energy $\alpha$.

In the range of possible phase plane geometries, the most interesting cases involve a spatial
admixture of qualitatively different critical points. In local coordinates $(p,q)$ around a 
critical point at ${(p,q)=(0,0)}$, assume the Hamiltonian becomes approximately quadratic, 
${2H\approx \kappa_p p^2+\kappa_q q^2}$. Then the sign of $\kappa_p\kappa_q$ distinguishes between 
circular points with $\kappa_p\kappa_q>0$ and hyperbolic points with $\kappa_p\kappa_q < 0$.
We have already seen that circular points imply local harmonic oscillation, but have yet
to encounter hyperbolic points or the separatrix curves they pair with. Choosing coordinates 
where $2H=p^2-q^2$, Hamilton's equations, $(\dot{p},\dot{q})=(q,p)$, 
are solved by hyperbolic trigonometric functions, ${p(t) = \sqrt{\alpha}\cosh(t)}$ and 
${q(t) = \sqrt{\alpha}\sinh(t)}$. Proof does not differ significantly from the earlier case 
of Harmonic oscillation. In fact, this similarity is the first sign of an even deeper 
transformation theory, which we will eventually take up and explore in detail.

Around a hyperbolic point, the Hamiltonian factors, $2H=(p+q)(p-q)$. Lines determined
by $p+q=0$ and $p-q=0$ intersect at the hyperbolic point. A separatrix curve, with $\alpha=0$, 
extends from those two lines outwards to the wider area of the phase plane. When the Hamiltonian 
contains terms higher than quadratic, a line leaving the hyperbolic point can possibly change 
direction. Then the separatrix segment either goes off to infinity, or it may return along 
another direction to the initial hyperbolic point, or it may even approach a second, distinct 
hyperbolic point. Taking a union over disjoint segments, the \textit{separatrix} curve is so 
named because, globally, it separates phase space into qualitatively different, non-intersecting 
subsets. For example, the red separatrix curve of Fig. \ref{fig:PendPortrait} separates the phase 
portrait into regions where the pendulum rotates either clockwise or counterclockwise, and another 
central region where libration occurs. 

A general \textit{oscillation disk} in the phase plane is defined as a topological disk bounded by 
a separatrix at energy $\alpha_1$, which additionally contains exactly one critical point, 
a circular point at energy $\alpha_0$. This domain also contains anharmonic oscillation within the energy range 
$\alpha \in (\alpha_0 , \alpha_1)$. Level curves around the circular point gradually deform away from a circular 
shape, but must retain loop topology. When a curve accumulates non-constant variation of curvature, 
the phase angular velocity $\dot{\phi}$ measures change of shape, as in Fig.~\ref{fig:HeatMap}. 
Most obviously, the heatmaps show slowing around the hyperbolic points, where the limit 
$\alpha \rightarrow \alpha_1$ causes an interval of the curve $\mathcal{C}_{\alpha}$ to pinch into a corner. 
These extreme deformations force $\dot{\phi}$ to approach zero locally, and the integral period
function diverges.

Choosing canonical coordinates $(p,q)=(\dot{\theta},\theta)/2$, the Hamiltonian function,  
\begin{eqnarray}
\alpha=2H(p,q)=p^2+\sin(q)^2, \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
models the motion of a simple pendulum. In the energy range $0<\alpha<1$, the curve geometry 
unifies to an oscillation disk, as in the left of Fig. ~\ref{fig:HeatMap}. The tangent expansion 
fails not only at the circular point $(q,p)=(0,0)$, but also at the hyperbolic points 
$(p,q)=(0,\pm \pi/2)$. The period function must increase from its harmonic limit at 
$\alpha=0$ to an infinite divergence at $\alpha=1$. Limiting analysis recapitulates what we 
should already know from preliminary analysis and laboratory experiments. At small amplitudes, 
the pendulum oscillates harmonically around the stable minimum. Larger amplitude oscillations 
eventually reach an inverted configuration where the force of gravity has only a small component 
along the direction of motion. Thus slowing occurs on approach to the unstable equilibrium point.  

The mere existence of singular divergences suggests that ordinary differential equations 
could be a useful tool for rigorously defining the pendulum's period function. At first 
we will prefer an easier, more direct analysis. Up to a second power of the action variable 
$\lambda$, the pendulum's Hamiltonian may be approximated as 
$\alpha/2=H(\lambda,\phi)=\lambda - \frac{2}{3}\lambda^2\sin(\phi)^4 $. 
Quadratic root solving yields twice the action $2\lambda=\frac{3}{2}\frac{1}{\sin(\phi)^4}
\Big(1-\sqrt{1-\frac{4}{3}\alpha \sin(\phi)^4}\Big)$, 
and by the chain rule, 
\begin{eqnarray}
T(\alpha) = \oint \frac{d\phi}{\dot{\phi}} =2 \oint d\phi\; \partial_{\alpha}\lambda 
= \oint \frac{d\phi}{\sqrt{1-\frac{4}{3}\alpha \sin(\phi)^4}} = 2\pi\bigg(1 + 
\frac{1}{4}\alpha + \frac{35}{192}\alpha^2 + \ldots \bigg) \nonumber .
\end{eqnarray}
This is a nice and easy trick! It gets the linear term correct, without any need for series reversion. 
However, the sine function is bounded by $\pm 1$, so the denominator goes to zero when $\alpha=3/4$,
and the critical points fall short at $|q|=\sqrt{3/2}<\pi/2$. After $c_0$ and $c_1$, all 
coefficients $c_n$ with $n>1$ are overestimates\footnote{It should be possible to
prove this assertion by induction on $n$.}. Instead, let us introduce an arbitrary 
trigonometric polynomial $\Phi$ and replace $(4/3)\sin(\phi)^4 \rightarrow \Phi $.
When $\Phi=\sin(\phi)^2$, the root solving procedure reproduces the correct period 
function. 

As $\Phi$ multiplies $\lambda^2$ in the Hamiltonian, any valid perturbing term needs $\Phi$ to 
be a homogeneous quartic polynomial in the variables $P=\cos(\phi)$, $Q=\sin(\phi)$. The quadratic 
choice $\Phi=Q^2$ obviously does not satisfy the validity constraint, but a workaround is available 
via the Pythagorean theorem, $P^2+Q^2=1$. Multiplication of $\Phi$ by the algebraic unit $P^2+Q^2$ 
raises the polynomial degree by $+2$. This allows a quartic choice $\Phi=(Q^2+P^2)Q^2$, 
which may reduce to $\Phi=Q^2$, but also identifies with a valid perturbing term. The algebraic Hamiltonian 
$2H(q,p)=(q^2+p^2)(1-\frac{1}{4}q^2)$ transforms canonically to its action-angle form, 
$H(\lambda,\phi)=\lambda - \frac{1}{2}\lambda^2\sin(\phi)^2 $, again quadratic in the variable $\lambda$.
This geometry includes an oscillation disk in the energy range $0<\alpha<1$, which appears in 
the center of Fig. ~\ref{fig:HeatMap}. By design, the quarter period of $H$ is $K(\alpha)$.

Determination of isoperiodicity suggests that the two Hamiltonian models,
\begin{eqnarray}
2H_i(q,p) = p^2 + \sin(q)^2 \text{\;\;\;\;and\;\;\;\;} 2H_f(q,p) = \Big(p^2 + q^2\Big)\bigg(1-\frac{1}{4} q^2\bigg), \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
will equate, $H_i(q_i,p_i)=H_f(q_f,p_f)$, by a canonical transformation between initial and final 
coordinates. A plausible guess that $p_i \;\dot{q}_i = p_f \;\dot{q}_f$ gives a second constraint 
equation in two unknowns. The non-linear system can be solved for either, 
\begin{eqnarray}
(p_i,q_i) &=& \bigg(\frac{1}{2}\;p_f\;\sqrt{4-q_f^2}, \;
\arcsin\Big(\frac{1}{2}q_f \sqrt{4-q_f^2}\Big)\bigg)
 \text{\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;or}  \nonumber \\ 
(p_f,q_f) &=& \pm \bigg(\csc(q_i) \;p_i\; \sqrt{2-2\cos(q_i)}, \; \sqrt{2-2\cos(q_i)} \bigg), \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
and the Jacobian matrices are written out as,
\begin{eqnarray}
J = \pm \begin{bmatrix} \sqrt{2-2\cos(q_i)} \csc(q_i) & \frac{p_i \tan(q_i/2)^2}{\sqrt{2-2\cos(q_i)}} \\
0 &  \frac{\sin(q_i)}{\sqrt{2-2\cos(q_i)}}
\end{bmatrix}  \;\;\;\;\; \text{and}  \;\;\;\;\; 
\widetilde{J} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{4-q_f^2}}{2} & -\frac{p_f q_f}{2\sqrt{4-q_f^2}} \\
0 & \frac{2}{\sqrt{4-q_f^2}} \end{bmatrix}\nonumber,
\end{eqnarray}
while requiring that $|q_f| \le \sqrt{2}$. The domain restriction is permissive enough to map 
between entire oscillation disks. According to the determinants, $\det(J)=\det{\widetilde{J}}=1$,
the transformation is verified canonical. This calculation shows that $\phi$ is indeed a 
canonical coordinate of the pendulum Hamiltonian. Solution of $\theta(t)$ follows from 
any solution of $\lambda(t)$ and $\phi(t)$, one of which we will now pursue in even 
more detail.

\section{Incorporating Complex Time}

Harold Edwards's theory of elliptic curves and elliptic functions starts with an 
alternative normal form, $x^2+y^2 = a^2+a^2 x^2 y^2$. The crucial elliptic function,
\begin{eqnarray}
\psi(t)= \chi(t+\tfrac{1}{2})= \frac{2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}e^{i \pi(2n-1)^2 \tau/2}\cos\big((2 n-1)\pi t \big) 
}{1+2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{i \pi(2n)^2 \tau/2}\cos\big(2 n \pi t \big)},\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
allows a solution $x(t)=\chi(t)$, and $y(t)=\psi(t)$ of
the coupled differential equations\footnote{Edwards's normalization of 
the time domain requires chain rule, $\dot{\psi}=(2/T) d\psi/dt  $, with real period $T$.}
${\dot{x}=y(1-a^2 x^2)}$ and $\dot{y}=-x(1-a^2 y^2)$,
as is proven in Part III of the original article \cite{EDWARDS2007}. Translation of Edwards's 
solution to the simple pendulum context encounters two difficulties. First, a  
transformation is needed to go from math coordinates $(x,y)$ to physical coordinates 
$(p,q)$\textemdash but this follows quickly from the previous developments. Second,
and with more effort, calculation of the correct value for the period ratio $\tau$ 
depends upon ascertainment of the double-periodicity notion. To this end, the Wick rotation, 
$t \rightarrow i t$, helps to extend transformation theory,
and to show relation between real and complex periods. 

Let us introduce a function $G$ such that $2G=(x^2+y^2)-a^2 x^2 y^2-a^2$,
and utilize $G$ to determine a family of elliptic curves, 
$\mathcal{C}_a=\{(x,y):2G(x,y,a)=0\}$. In a sense, function $G$ is Hamiltonian 
with canonical coordinates $x$ and $y$; however, the analogy can be improved. 
Transforming coordinates by  $(G,a,x,y) \rightarrow (H,\alpha,p,q)=(a^2 G,a^4,a\;y,a\;x)$ 
produces a Hamiltonian form, $\alpha=2H=p^2+q^2 - p^2 \; q^2$. In action angle 
coordinates, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = \lambda-\frac{1}{2}\lambda^2\sin(2\phi)^2$. 
Anharmonic oscillation occurs with real period, 
\begin{eqnarray}
T(\alpha) = 4K(\alpha) = \oint \frac{d\phi}{\sqrt{1-\alpha\sin(2\phi)^2}},\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
and an exact parameterization $p(t)=\alpha^{1/4} \;\psi(t)$, $q(t)=\alpha^{1/4} \;\chi(t)$. 
Another transformation, $(t_i,\phi_i)\rightarrow (t_f,\phi_f)=2(t_i,\phi_i)$, is not
canonical, but nevertheless preserves Hamilton's equations  covariantly\footnote{Covariant: 
$|J|=\frac{\partial t_f}{\partial t_i}$. Two non-canonical transformations act together as 
a canonical transformation.}. Angle doubling allows exact solution, 
\begin{eqnarray}
\lambda(t) = \frac{\sqrt{\alpha}}{2}\Big(\chi(\tfrac{t}{2})^2 + \psi(\tfrac{t}{2})^2\Big), \;\;\;\;\; 
\phi(t)   =  \arctan\big(\chi(\tfrac{t}{2})/\psi(\tfrac{t}{2})\big),  \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
of the earlier pendulum model, $H = \lambda-\frac{1}{2}\lambda^2\sin(\phi)^2$, or in Cartesian 
coordinates, 
\begin{eqnarray}
p(t)   =  \frac{ \; \psi(\tfrac{t}{2})^2-\chi(\tfrac{t}{2})^2 
}{\Big(1+\chi(\tfrac{t}{2})^2  \psi(\tfrac{t}{2})^2\Big)^{\frac{1}{2}}},  \;\;\;\;\; 
q(t)  = \frac{2 \;  \chi(\tfrac{t}{2})\;\psi(\tfrac{t}{2}) 
}{\Big(1+\chi(\tfrac{t}{2})^2 \psi(\tfrac{t}{2})^2\Big)^{\frac{1}{2}}}. \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
Time parameterization for pendulum variables $\theta$ and $\dot{\theta}$ then follows by 
walking back $(\lambda,\phi)$ through the sequence of canonical transformations,
\begin{eqnarray}
\theta(t) &=& 2 \arcsin\bigg(\frac{2\;\chi(\tfrac{t}{2})\; \psi(\tfrac{t}{2})
}{1+\chi(\tfrac{t}{2})^2 \psi(\tfrac{t}{2})^2 }\bigg), \nonumber \\
\dot{\theta}(t) &=& 2\bigg(\frac{\psi(\tfrac{t}{2})^2 - \chi(\tfrac{t}{2})^2
}{1+\chi(\tfrac{t}{2})^2 \psi(\tfrac{t}{2})^2 }\bigg). \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
The expression for $\theta(t)$ reduces according to a special case of the $X$ addition 
rule, proven in Part II of \cite{EDWARDS2007}. The addition rules act linearly along 
the time dimension, so the choice of $x'=x=\chi(\tfrac{t}{2})$ and 
$y'=y=\psi(\tfrac{t}{2})$ sets $X=\chi(t)$, and also, 
\begin{eqnarray}
\theta(t) = 2 \arcsin\Big(\alpha^{1/4}\;\chi\big(t\big) \Big).  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Yet this formal solution is worthless until we have defined the period ratio $\tau$ as a 
function of the energy parameter $\alpha$. In context, the correct answer is that 
$\tau = i \frac{K(1-\alpha)}{2K(\alpha)}$, but again, why?

The real period $T(\alpha)$ itself gives a first hint of double-periodicity, because 
it satisfies a second order differential equation. A proof of the assertion depends upon 
an annihilator $\mathcal{A}$ and its certificate function $\Xi$, 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{A}=1-4(1-2\alpha)\partial_{\alpha}-4\alpha(1-\alpha)\partial^2_{\alpha}  
 \;\;\;\;\;\;\; \text{and} \;\;\;\;\;\;\;
\Xi_n = \frac{\sin(2 \; n \; \phi)}{2\;n\;\big(1-\alpha \sin(n\;\phi)^2\big)^{3/2}}. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
The zero sum,
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{A}\circ \bigg(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\alpha\;\sin(n\;\phi)^2}}\bigg) 
-\partial_{\phi}\Xi_n =0 \nonumber, 
\end{eqnarray}
is trivial to verify by applying chain rule and reducing trigonometric terms. 
Integration of any exact differential along a complete cycle yields a zero, 
including $\oint \; d\phi \; \partial_{\phi} \Xi_n=0$, thus the claim, 
$\mathcal{A}\circ T(\alpha)=0$, stands true. The transformation 
$\alpha \rightarrow 1-\alpha$ leaves $\mathcal{A}$ invariant, so the general solution 
of the second order differential equation can be written as 
$T(\alpha)=c_1 K(\alpha)+ c_2 K(1-\alpha)$. This solution space includes two special 
solutions, the real and complex periods, $T_{\mathfrak{R}}(\alpha)=4\;K(\alpha)$ and 
$T_{\mathfrak{I}}(\alpha)=i 2K(1-\alpha)$, whose ratio reproduces the suggested 
form $\tau=T_{\mathfrak{I}}(\alpha)/T_{\mathfrak{R}}(\alpha)$. 
The hint seems to have paid off, but leaves room for doubt and suspicion. 

We do not yet have a physical reason to complexify the time variable by extending from a one-dimensional
real axis to a two-dimensional complex plane; however, mathematical function theory calls ahead of 
schedule for just such an abstraction. To account for additional complex degrees of freedom, we will build out a Riemann 
surface\footnote{The nomenclature "Kleinian Surface" may be better.
According to Jeremy Gray, Felix Klein was the first to make full use of a four-dimensional 
perspective. }, 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{R}_{\alpha} = \{(p,q) \in \mathbb{C}^2: \alpha=2H(p,q) \} 
\simeq \{(v,w,x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^4: \alpha=2H(x+i v,y+i w) \},\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
around each phase curve $\mathcal{C}_{\alpha}$. If transformation of canonical $p$ and $q$ 
variables introduces determinant $|J| \in \mathbb{C}/\{0,1\}$, then neither the two-form 
$dp \wedge dq$, nor the time scale $dt$, nor Hamilton's equations will preserve. However, 
it is possible to cancel the extra factor $|J|$ by scaling time covariantly, 
$t_i \rightarrow t_f = |J|\;t_i$. Any transformation with unit modulus $|J|$ acts as 
rotation on the complex $t$-plane. In particular, the Wick rotation,  
$t_i\rightarrow t_f = i \; t_i$, goes by $\pi/2$ radians through the time plane, 
thus permutes real and complex axes. The simplest covariant coordinate transformation
having $|J|=i$ takes $p_i\rightarrow p_f=i\;p_i$ and rotates $\mathcal{R}_{\alpha}$  by 
$\pi/2$ radians through a four dimensional space $\mathbb{C}^2 \simeq \mathbb{R}^4$.
Covariant Wick rotation is another neat trick, which ultimately allows calculation of 
the complex period on doubly-periodic $\mathcal{R}_{\alpha}$ by integration along a 
real-valued level curve $\widetilde{\mathcal{C}}_{\alpha}$. Before moving ahead to non-trivial 
topology, it is worthwhile to work through the simplest example in genus zero.

Real-valued theory distinguishes between circular points and hyperbolic points, while 
complex-valued theory does not. Any transformation such as $(p_i,q_i) \rightarrow (p_f,q_f)=(i\;p_i,q_i)$ 
changes constraints, from circular $\alpha=2H=p^2+q^2$ to hyperbolic $\alpha=2\widetilde{H}=-p^2+q^2$,
and \textit{vice versa}. It is possible to embed the entire \textit{harmonic hyperboloid} 
into three dimensions,
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{R}_{\alpha}&=&\{(p,q)\in \mathbb{C}^2: \alpha  =p^2+q^2 \} \nonumber \\
&\rightarrow& \mathcal{S}_{\alpha}=\{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3: \alpha + z^2 =x^2+y^2 \}, \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
while loosing only a phase degree of freedom via the map $(v,w) \rightarrow z=\pm \sqrt{v^2+w^2}$.
More explicitly, $\mathcal{S}_{\alpha}$ is obtained from $\mathcal{R}_{\alpha}$ after considering 
rotational symmetry in the $(p,q)$-plane. Coordinates $x=w=0$ and $z=v$ may be chosen such that 
$\widetilde{\mathcal{C}}_{\alpha}=\{(y,z): \alpha=-z^2+y^2 \}$ is a hyperbola connected to the base circle 
$\mathcal{C}_{\alpha}=\{(x,y): \alpha=x^2+y^2 \}$ at the branch points ${(p, q)=(0,\pm \sqrt{\alpha})}$. 
Any other point $(p,q)=(x_0,y_0)$ along $\mathcal{C}_{\alpha}$ is yet again a branch point; however, 
in a rotated coordinate system. Point $(x_0,y_0)$ connects circular $\mathcal{C}_{\alpha}$ to a 
\textit{rotated copy} of hyperbolic $\widetilde{\mathcal{C}}_{\alpha}$, which
falls in the hyperplane determined by  $(x_0 \;u+y_0 \;v)(x_0 \;y-y_0 \;x)=0$.

Two equivalent parameterizations,  
\begin{eqnarray}
&\mathcal{R}_{\alpha} =& \bigg\{
(p,q)=\Big(\sqrt{\alpha}\sin(t),\sqrt{\alpha}\cos(t)\Big) \in \mathbb{C}^2
: t \in \mathbb{C} \bigg\},  \nonumber  \\
\text{and} \;\;\;\;\;
&\widetilde{\mathcal{R}}_{\alpha} =& \bigg\{
(p,q)=\Big(\sqrt{\alpha}\sinh(u),\sqrt{\alpha}\cosh(u)\Big)  \in \mathbb{C}^2
: u \in \mathbb{C} \bigg\},  
 \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
of the harmonic hyperboloid follow from the solution of Hamilton's equations, 
around a circular point and a hyperbolic point respectively. Wick rotation $t\rightarrow u= i\;t$ 
equates $\mathcal{R}_{\alpha}$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{R}}_{\alpha}$ up to a $\pi/2$-radian rotation 
through the complex $p$-plane. While the usual trigonometric functions are periodic, 
their hyperbolic counterparts certainly are not. Taken together periodicity along 
$\mathfrak{R}(t)$ and non-periodicity along $\mathfrak{R}(u)$ implies genus zero. 
This identification introduces some cognitive dissonance, because the sphere is 
usually given as the standard form of a genus zero surface. In three dimensions, 
the hyperboloid,
\begin{eqnarray}
&\mathcal{S}_{\alpha} =& \bigg\{
(x,y,z)=\Big(\sqrt{\alpha}\sin(t)\cosh(u),
\sqrt{\alpha}\cos(t)\cosh(u),
\sqrt{\alpha}\sinh(u)\Big) \in \mathbb{R}^3
: (t,u) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \bigg\},  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
transforms into the Riemann sphere by stereographic projection,
\begin{eqnarray}
(x,y,z) \rightarrow \bigg(X,Y,Z\bigg)=\bigg(\frac{2\sqrt{\alpha}\;x}{\alpha+x^2+y^2},
\frac{2\sqrt{\alpha}\;y}{\alpha+x^2+y^2}, \pm \frac{(\alpha-x^2-y^2)}{(\alpha+x^2+y^2)}\bigg),
 \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
with $+$ chosen for $z \ge 0$ and $-$ chosen otherwise.

With two invariant time-translations rather than just one, a genus one elliptic curve 
differs qualitatively from the genus zero harmonic hyperboloid. In general, the two periods may describe the 
boundaries of a \textit{period parallelogram} in the complex $t$-plane; however, in Edwards's normal 
form, a choice of real $\alpha \in (0,1)$ amounts to choosing a \textit{period rectangle} with entirely 
complex $\tau$ and $\mathfrak{I}(\tau) \in (0,\infty)$. To calculate $\tau$ explicitly, we transform 
by a Wick rotation, $H \rightarrow \widetilde{H}$, as in Fig. \ref{fig:ToricSecs}. Both transforms 
introduce a factor $|J|=i$ relative to the initial choice of coordinates\footnote{
Easy Exercise: Prove $|J|=i$ explicitly, then prove the two alternatives canonically equivalent.}.
Constraint $\alpha=2\widetilde{H}$, for either $\widetilde{H}$, cuts out a real-valued curve 
$\widetilde{\mathcal{C}}_{\alpha}$. Hamilton's equations determine the complex period, 
up to a missing factor $i$. One choice leads to an easier integral,
\begin{eqnarray}
T_{\mathfrak{I}}(\alpha) = i \oint dt = i \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{dp}{\sqrt{(1+p^2)(\alpha+p^2)}},  \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
on a non-compact contour, while the other offers compactness with a harmonic limit 
$\omega=2$ as $\alpha \rightarrow 1$. Integral value $T_{\mathfrak{I}}(1) = i \pi$ also 
implies that $\omega = 2\pi i/T_{\mathfrak{I}}(1) =2$.  More importantly, the zero sum, 
\begin{eqnarray}\mathcal{A} \circ \frac{1}{\sqrt{(1+p^2)(\alpha+p^2)}} 
+ \partial_p \; \widetilde{\Xi} = 0, \;\;\;\text{with}\;\;\; 
\widetilde{\Xi} = \frac{p\;(1+p^2)^{1/2}}{(\alpha+p^2)^{3/2}},  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
certifies that $\mathcal{A} \circ T_{\mathfrak{I}}(\alpha)=0$, because
$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dp \; \partial_{p} \widetilde{\Xi}=0$. The harmonic 
limit determines the constants of integration, and $T_{\mathfrak{I}}(\alpha) = i 2K(1-\alpha)$,
as desired. Depending on the reader's naivet\'{e}, it is either astounding or mundane that 
both real and complex solutions should satisfy the same differential equation. The 
cohomological theory of algebraic varieties gives a standard mathematical explanation
as to \textit{why}, but for now we are more concerned with the ever-pressing 
\textit{what for}.

Unlike their trigonometric counterparts, the shape of functions $\chi(t)$ and $\psi(t)$ 
depends on the amplitude parameter $\alpha$ via the period ratio $\tau=i\frac{K(1-\alpha)}{2K(\alpha)}$. 
Shape variation with $\alpha$ carries over to the Riemann surface,
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{R}_{\alpha} = \Big\{\big(p,q\big)
=\big(\alpha^{\frac{1}{4}} \;\psi(t), \; \alpha^{\frac{1}{4}} \;\chi(t)\big) 
\in \mathbb{C}^2 : t \in \mathbb{C} \Big\}, \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
which limits to a central harmonic hyperboloid when $\alpha \rightarrow 0$ 
and $\mathfrak{I}(t) \rightarrow 2n\; i\; \tau, \; n \in \mathbb{Z}$. Around 
$\mathfrak{I}(t)=0$, surface $\mathcal{R}_{\alpha}$ looks sufficiently like the 
harmonic hyperboloid to allow a similar embedding\footnote{The map  
$(p,q) \rightarrow (x,y,z)$, from $\mathcal{R}_{\alpha}$ to $\mathcal{S}_{\alpha}$, 
preserves the euclidean metric: $p^{\star}p+q^{\star}q=x^2+y^2+z^2$.},
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{S}_{\alpha} = \Big\{\big(x,y,z\big)
=\big(
\alpha^{\frac{1}{4}}\;\psi_{\mathfrak{R}}(t),
\; \alpha^{\frac{1}{4}}\;\chi_{\mathfrak{R}}(t), 
\;\pm \alpha^{\frac{1}{4}} \sqrt{\chi_{\mathfrak{I}}(t)^2+\psi_{\mathfrak{I}}(t)^2} \; \big) 
\in \mathbb{R}^3 : t \in \mathbb{R} \times[0,\pm \tfrac{\tau}{2}] \Big\}. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Subscripts $\mathfrak{R}$ and $\mathfrak{I}$ indicate either the real or the imaginary 
component of complex-valued functions $\psi(t)$ and $\chi(t)$. Hyperbolic sections also 
expand over thin strip domains of width $\Delta t =1/4$, centered on vertical lines 
$\mathfrak{R}(t)=(2n+1)/4, \; n \in \mathbb{Z}$. These four sections separately approach a 
harmonic hyperboloid in the limit $\alpha \rightarrow 1$. In the right panel of Fig. \ref{fig:ToricRibbons},
the partial domain of all five hyperbolic sections covers a full three-quarters of $\mathbb{C}$
while avoiding points $\tau + n/2, \; n\in \mathbb{Z}$. At these points, either $\chi$ or $\psi$ has 
a pole. Arranging the disjoint pieces and coloring by the real component of time, we expand from 
the skeleton of Fig. \ref{fig:ToricSecs} to the compact surfaces nested in the left of 
Fig. \ref{fig:ToricRibbons}. Admittedly, the patchwork surfaces look sketchy, but so far we have 
yet to find a better depiction of the $\alpha$-dependent complex tori associated to genus one. 

Depiction of complex tori flexes impressive strength, but actually requires considerably more 
effort than is necessary for applications in physics. With only values of $\psi(t)$ above the
real axis, we can graph sections of a Hamiltonian flow and make a wide range of experimental 
predictions\textemdash the two tasks are not really any different. Fig. XXX depicts the 
pendulum's Hamiltonian flow,
\begin{eqnarray}
adsf , \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
along with two other related flows. These graphs are the end desire of any textbook exercise,
but no excercise is complete without double check. Need convergence of the $t$-independent 
zero-sums, 
\begin{eqnarray}
0 = 2 H(q(t),q(t))-\alpha = \dot{p}(t) + \partial_{q} H|_t = \dot{q}(t) - \partial_{p} H|_t, 
\;\;\; 0 < \alpha < .99, \;\;\;t \in \mathbb{R},  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
to floating-point precision $(\sim 10^{16})$. This can and should be verified numerically. 


\section{Conclusion}

Hamiltonian mechanics powerful method for analyzing periods, 
especially with transform theory. It is nice to go to 
algebraic form, then surfaces can be analyzed in terms of 
homology and diff. Eqs. Many future directions. Comparison 
with quartic oscillator and addition rules. Certificates 
must be related to addition rules, but this has yet to 
be adressed. Other plane curve geometries, curves of higher 
genus, and curves on a sphere. Modular forms and modular 
functions, but these are all interesting mathematical 
offshoots, but we are more interested in physics.

The main result is that it is somewhat easy to derive 
diff Eqs. for periods, this is useful technique. In fact
period is first order observable in experiments, and 
even determines spectral observables in the semi-classics.
We pland to expand on these topics in a sequence of subsequent 
articles. The immediate next will be experimental.
